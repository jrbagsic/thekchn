You can work together with the artist to create a unique tattoo. Our suggestion for custom pieces, coverups, or larger pieces is to come by for a consultation first

                                Clients are permitted one reschedule before a new deposit must be made. Notice of reschedules must be made 3 days prior to the day of your appointment. This does not pertain to situations in which the artist has requested to reschedule.
                                Short notice reschedules (within 3 days of the appointment date) and cancellations/no shows result in the forfeit of your deposit.
                                Please reach out to your artist and let them know if you need to cancel or reschedule.

                                Maintain your hygiene! That means taking a shower and wearing deodorant. Getting a tattoo means being up close and personal with our artists, so make sure you are smelling great and feeling clean.
                                Dress appropriately. Make sure to wear loose clothing that can easily reveal the area being tattooed. Keep in mind that tattoos on the torso, especially on the ribs may require you to be shirtless. If this makes you uncomfortable, consider wearing a button down shirt that can be flipped to reveal the area while covering your front.
                                Eat and hydrate prior to the appointment.
                                Do not drink alcohol the night before your appointment.
                                Bring a water bottle just in case, hydration is important!

                                HYPAFIX / TATU-DERM: The first application should be removed within 12 to 24 hours. Clean with unscented soap, then dry and reapply. If given a second application keep it on for 2-5 days. After the bandage has been removed, clean it and start moisturizing with a light layer of tattoo balm or unscented lotion.
                                SARAN WRAP / NON-ADHESIVE BANDAGE: 12 hours after being tattooed you will need to remove the wrap. Use an unscented soap to wash the tattoo gently. Pat down with a clean paper towel until dry, then apply a thin layer of tattoo balm or unscented lotion. Do not re-bandage the tattoo.
                                AFTER BANDAGE REMOVAL: Keep the tattoo dry. No swimming, hot tubs, baths or submerging in water for 2 - 4 weeks. Showers are fine; just don't have the tattoo under the water too long. Try your best to avoid direct sunlight 2 weeks. Avoid using antibiotic- and petroleum-based ointments, such as Vaseline, and Polysporin.
